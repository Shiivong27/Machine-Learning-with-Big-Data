# Machine-Learning-with-Big-Data

Predicting rain or weather is a common problem in machine learning. Different machine learning algorithms can be used to model and predict rainfall. In this assignment, we complete the analysis to predict whether there will be rain tomorrow or not. In particular, we are required to apply the tools of machine learning to visualize and predict the possibility of rainfall in Australia.
