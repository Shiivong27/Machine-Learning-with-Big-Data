# Machine-Learning-with-Big-Data
Predicting rain or weather is a common problem in machine learning. Different machine                           learning algorithms can be used to model and predict rainfall. In this assignment, we ask                               you to complete the analysis to predict whether there will be rain tomorrow or not. In                                 particular, you are required to apply the tools of machine learning to visualize and                             predict the possibility of rainfall in Australia.
